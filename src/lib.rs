//! Tetra is a simple 2D game framework written in Rust. It uses SDL2 for event handling and OpenGL 3.2+ for rendering.
//!
//! * [Website](https://tetra.seventeencups.net)
//! * [API Docs](https://docs.rs/tetra)
//! * [FAQ](https://tetra.seventeencups.net/FAQ)
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! * XNA/MonoGame-inspired API
//! * Efficient 2D rendering, with draw call batching by default
//! * Easy input handling, via polling or events, with support for gamepads
//! * Deterministic game loop by default, Ã  la [Fix Your Timestep](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/)
//! * Common building blocks built-in, such as:
//!     * Font rendering
//!     * Cameras
//!     * Screen scaling
//!
//! ## Installation
//!
//! To add Tetra to your project, add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:
//!
//! ```toml
//! tetra = "0.3"
//! ```
//!
//! You will also need to install the SDL2 native libraries - full details are provided in the [documentation](https://tetra.seventeencups.net/installation).
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! To get a simple window displayed on screen, the following code can be used:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use tetra::graphics::{self, Color};
//! use tetra::{Context, ContextBuilder, State};
//!
//! struct GameState;
//!
//! impl State for GameState {
//!     fn draw(&mut self, ctx: &mut Context) -> tetra::Result {
//!         // Cornflower blue, as is tradition
//!         graphics::clear(ctx, Color::rgb(0.392, 0.584, 0.929));
//!         Ok(())
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! fn main() -> tetra::Result {
//!     ContextBuilder::new("Hello, world!", 1280, 720)
//!         .build()?
//!         .run(|_| Ok(GameState))
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! You can see this example in action by running `cargo run --example hello_world`.
//!
//! The full list of examples is available [here](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra/tree/release/examples).
//!
//! ## Support/Feedback
//!
//! Tetra is fairly early in development, so you might run into bugs/flaky docs/general weirdness. Please feel free to open an issue/PR if you find something!
