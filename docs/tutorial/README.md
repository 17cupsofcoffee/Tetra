In this tutorial, we'll build a simple Pong clone using Tetra.

This guide is targeted at people who have a basic understanding of Rust, but might not have done any game development before. If you have read [*The Rust Programming Language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/), you should be able to follow along without getting lost - if you can't, please [file an issue](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/tetra/issues) so I can fix that!
